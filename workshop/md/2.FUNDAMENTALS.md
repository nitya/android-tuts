# Fundamentals

#### Core Concepts
* Application = combination of distinct components
* Each component can be activated independently by another; consequently applications have _multiple points of entry_
* A component may be activated by a component in a different app; this may require the user to grant specific *permissions*.
* Components are activated using _intents_
