# Overview

#### What is Android?
* An application development platform for creating mobile games and apps
* A growing ecosystem of mobile devices with an attached app marketplace

#### What is an Android Application?
* A combination of distinct _components_ each of which can be invoked separately.
* Components are written in Java, compiled to _.dex_ bytecode and packaged into _.apk_ files for distribution (on markets) and installation (on devices)

* Each application runs in a _secure sandbox_ on a device; the application is hosted in its own process and runs within its own _Dalvik_ VM, isolating it from others.
* Each application is also given a unique Linux _user id_ which is associated wiht all its files; this prevents apps from accessing files, resources of others.
* The Android runtime enforces the _Principle of Least Privilege_, allowing apps to access just the minimum set of resources/components to execute their task.
* The Android runtime manages the lifecycle of applications; applications simply receive callbacks at various stages (start, pause, stop,..) to perform actions.


#### What is the Android Architecture?

The figure shows the Android Architecture Stack which consists of 5 regions:
1. _The Linux Kernel_ ==> abstracts hardware platform from the software stack, manages processes, memory, I/O, device drivers, networking and security.
2. _Native Libraries_ ==> C/C++ libraries, services and daemons for efficient low-level processing (includes WebKit engine, media codecs etc.)
3. _The Android Runtime_ ==> Provides the Java runtime (close to Java SE in content + Dalvik VM)
4. _Application Framework_ ==> Abstracts native library complexity from high-level applications (e.g., provides management services for activity lifecycle, location, resources, data..)
5. _Core Applications_ ==> Core/3rd-party apps that provide popular features (e.g., Contacts, Phone, Browser). Can be replaced by user or device manufacturer.

Standard Android applications (written in Java) exist at the Applications layer. Native Android applications (written in C/C++) will reside at the Libraries layer.

#### What is the Android Development Environment?

* The code development platform consists of the Android SDK (Standard Development Kit) and can include the Android NDK (Native Development Kit)
* Two development options: ADT (Eclipse-based IDE) and Android Studio (IntelliJ-based IDE)
* We will be using ADT 22.3 (latest version 22.6 works too but has some issues)

#### What is Android Versioning?

The complete list of releases and versions is available on [the Android Source site](https://source.android.com/source/build-numbers.html). The [Android Developer Site](http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html) maintains a dashboard of the distribution of _installed_ versions in the world, allowing you (as a developer) to decide what version(s) to target in your application in order to make the optimal tradeoff between using the latest features and addressing the largest market size.

The following table was updated on May 1, 2014

| VERSION | CODENAME | API | DISTRIBUTION |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| 4.0.x | Ice Cream Sandwich | 15 | 13.4% |
| 4.1.x | Jelly Bean | 16 | 33.5% |
| 4.2.x | Jelly Bean | 17 | 18.8% |
| 4.3 | Jelly Bean | 18 | 8.5% |
| 4.4 | Jelly Bean | 19 | 8.5% |


As shown in the table, each Android version has the following:
* Android versions each have an API level, a codename and a version number.
* The _API level_ increases in strict numerical order (based on feature releases)
* The _version_ has major/minor components that indicate the magnitude of the features/fixes that caused the API level change. (e.g., 3.x to 4.x is a major change, 4.1 to 4.2 is a moderate change, 4.0.1 to 4.0.2 is a minor change)
* The _codename_ is a user-friendly reference given in alphabetical order, named after pastry. The last three codenames are Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean and KitKat.
* The most critical information is the API level, which is used in the application Manifest to determine the range of supported devices based on API level compliance.
* My preference is to stick with API levels 14 and higher (Android ICS, JellyBean, KitKat) which cover ~83% of distribution (and growing) and support most newer features.
